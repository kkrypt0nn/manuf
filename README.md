# Manuf Project

The **_Manuf Project_** is a project made to keep an up to date list of MAC addresses prefixes and their manufacturer.

## Update

The list is updated every hour and can be used as you wish.

## Available Libraries

I've personally made three libraries in three programming languages that uses this list.

- [`Rust`](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/rsmanuf)
- [`Python`](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/pymanuf)
- [`Go`](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/gomanuf)

Each folder has its own `README` file with the instructions on how to use the library.
